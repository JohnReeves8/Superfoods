*1.0, 2014-06-19 19:48*

- Current weight :    kg
- Goal           :    kg
- Diet Duration  : 4 - 8 weeks (expect a loss of between 1.0 - 0.5 kg per week)
- Expect visible results within 2 weeks (better fitting clothes, for example)

### Exercise

**Every day:**

- walking, riding or swimming for 40 - 60 minutes

-- Your goal is to burn 3500 calories per week. That's 10,000 steps per day,
   walking, for example. You burn about 100 calories for every mile walked.  You
   can find calculators online (like: http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/lookup)
   for working out how many calories each type of exercise burns.

-- Swimming is one of the best because you burn extra calories in the cooler
   water just keeping your body warm. Besides, swimming is great for your
   lungs and figure.

### Diet

There isn't one answer here. There are a variety of different types of diets you
could choose -- which is good because if one doesn't suit you, you can try another.

I'll give you one of my favourites:

#### Calorie Controlled, Low GI Conscious Eating

You need to know your daily calorie limit, and you need a rough idea of how many
calories are in the typical foods and meals you eat every day. Spend some time
early on researching this and it will make the rest of your diet easy. There are
many calorie calculators/tables online, like: http://www.calorieking.com/foods/
and http://nutritiondata.self.com/

**Low GI Restrictions:**

- Avoid added sugar. That means, no:
-- soda drinks (like Coke, Pepsi, Sprite, etc)
-- fruit juice/drinks
-- any drinks with added sugar (like soy milk, mixed teas/coffees, etc)
-- packaged foods (check the labels -- most have added sugar; don't eat it)
--- This includes ALL packaged snacks, like Chips/crisps/tofu/flavoured nuts/etc
    Basically, avoid packaged foods.

- Avoid processed foods. That means, no:
-- flour and flour products, like:
--- noodles, bread, cakes, pastries
-- white-rice
-- packaged meats (contain a lot of starch -- avoid starch)

- Avoid dairy. That means, no:
-- butter, milk, cheese (but unsweetened yoghurt is okay)

- Avoid heavy fats. That means, no:
-- fatty meats (lean meat is okay)
-- oily cooked dishes -- if it's swimming in oil, don't eat it.

- Avoid alcohol

**Good Foods:**


- Choose fresh fruits and vegetables -- but not overcooked, dead vegetables
  drowned in oil. RAW fruit and vegetables are the best, but stir-fried in
  small amounts of oil, or (better) steamed or boiled are best. Wash them well,
  peel them if necessary. Raw vegetables and nuts make a great snack.

- Choose eggs

- Choose lean beef and chicken (pork and lamb are too fatty -- have
  pork and lamb only occasionally)

- Choose fish

- Choose raw (or at least unsweetened) nuts (not too many peanuts)

- Choose beans (wonderful low GI carbohydrate). All beans are good
  (don't eat too many soy beans).

- Drink plenty of water


Proteins will make you feel full, so make sure you are eating enough protein,
like eggs, meat and beans.


Eat at least three meals a day -- **do not** skip meals. A piece of fruit or
some carrot and cucumber sticks make a great snack when you don't feel like
a full meal. Boiled eggs are another excellent snack food. As are nuts.

As long as you stay under your daily calorie limit, there's no problem with
you slowly grazing all day -- that means you can nibble on heaps of vegetables,
fruits, beans & nuts (not *too many* nuts) all day. And then still eat three
proper meals.


**Two other alternatives (which you can research online) are:**

* The Mediterranean diet
* The mixed/balanced (DASH) diet


### Tasks:

- Keep a food and exercise diary.

- Find out the amount of calories you need to eat per day to lose
  weight.  Use this calculator:
  http://www.calorieking.com/interactive-tools/how-many-calories-should-you-eat/
  (For daily activity level, select "Light" and click "Lose Weight"
  in the bottom panel.)

- Find out what that many calories per day looks like:
-- How many calories on a typical plate of food?
-- How many in a handful of snacks (vegetables, fruits and nuts)?

- Find out your real current weight today and write it in your diary.

- Record your weight every week. If you're not losing weight on the scales,
  don't worry -- your body will redistribute muscle for fat and that will
  appear on the scales as if you're not losing anything because muscle
  weighs more than fat. Pay more attention to the fit of your clothes or the
  line of your figure in the mirror. **Do NOT** give up because the scales are
  telling you bad things. Ignore them. Write down their number and then ignore
  them. In a few weeks, they'll have nice things to say to you again. :-)


### NOTES:

- If you stay under your weekly calorie allowance, you will lose weight.

- Recalculate your daily calorie needs every time you lose 0.5 kg on the scales.

- Stay hydrated (drink plenty of water) when doing exercise.

- If you feel sick, dizzy, or in any other way unwell on this regimen, consult
  professional advice.
